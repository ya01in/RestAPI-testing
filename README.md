## Requirements

* Select any of the API mentioned in [public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
* Write 2 (or more) test cases for any of the above API options
* implement an automation test for each test case using Python
* For each test case:
  * Clear steps for the test
  * Expected result
  * How the expected result will be validated (make sure the answer is what we expected)
  * Implementation in Python.
  * (recommendation) Use Pytest parametrize to reduce code but maintain high coverage.
  * A mixture of positive and negative scenarios
* Think in framework design and modularity
* README should include the test case written for the test in a table form
* Description of what validation is been used and why the candidate used this type of validation
